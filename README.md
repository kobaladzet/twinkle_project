# Twinkle✨
---

Twinkle is an interactive astrology and tarot web app. It combines zodiac wisdom, tarot card animations, and a clean responsive UI to offer a magical user experience. The project was developed as a part of the final examination requirement. 
Api is from [tarot api](https://tarotapi.dev/) and a local json file created by the help of AI. Most of the ilustrations are generated by AI. The project is identical to the figma design made by me.

On the first sight user can pick a card as a daily reader, which represents their luck. Then they can read about their zodiac signns,
what they represent and how it is expressed on their treats based on sun moon and rising signs which they can choose by clicking on the "srart" button.
